Anaconda is a scientific Python distribution. It has no IDE of its own. The default IDE bundled with Anaconda is Spyder which is just another Python package that can be installed even
without Anaconda.

Anaconda bundles a whole bunch of Python packages that are commonly used by people using Python for scientific computing and/or data science. It provides a single download and an install
program/script that installs all the packages in one go. Alternatively, one can install Python first and then individually install all the required packages using pip.

Additionally, it provides its own package manager (conda) and package repository. But it allows installation of packages from PyPI using pip if the package is not in Anaconda repositories.
It is especially good if you are installing on Microsoft Windows as it can easily install packages that would otherwise require you to install C/C++ compilers and libraries if you were
using pip. It is certainly an added advantage that conda, in addition to being a package manager, is also a virtual environment manager allowing you to install independent development
environments and switch from one to the other (similar to virtualenv).

There is a minimal Anaconda Python without all the packages, called Miniconda. After installing miniconda, you can use conda and install only those scientific packages that you wish
and avoid a bloated installation.

In summary, there is no Anaconda IDE, it is just Spyder only.
